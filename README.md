# PyKernelOS (pkOS)
# os made by: 
# niko: giggly.niko (on discord)
# witheringaway: witheringaway (on discord)

Description: so PyKernelOS is a (fake???) kernel type of os in python.
thats all really need to say to get your hopes up, (or something else ðŸ¤¨)
so um, idk what to say about this os, its really just a fun project 

# nice nice, what is the frickin bios.py and other shit like PyKernelOS.boot
so ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i forgor jk so theres uh some stuff like
1. bios.py (basically an app that allows to boot the bootloader)
2. bootloader does funkey stuff like Settings :O
3. in bootloader you get to logon.py (if u have anonymous mode on then it goes straight to main.py)
4. logon.py goes to main.py
6. fuck you i cant explain shit

# Apps
woah woah apps?!!!! you can make your own apps!!!????
yeah you can, just get ready to code in python

how tf do i make apps you dumb fuck:
1. create a file called (whateveruwant).ap3
IT HAS TO END WITH AP3!!! pkOS wont detect it that way.

2. write funny python code!!! (withering hates python)
so originally there was supposed to be go and lua support for apps
but that dose not worke :c 

3. save the app and check out the app!!!!

# built in apps?!!!
awah wah there are cool apps like calculator lmao
jk a really cool app is called ap3store.ap3
IT WAS SUPEER HARD TO DO.
really hard btw

# SETTINGS??!!!!!!!
yeah settings you can set them in the files/settings/settings.json folder, 
or you can go to bootloader and u have there settings :3
