# PyKernelOS (pkOS)
# os made by: 
# niko: giggly.niko (on discord)
# witheringaway: witheringaway (on discord)

# libraries to install OwO
you need python for pkOS, if you didnt know...
command to install those libraries:

``pip install requests beautifulsoup4 Flask``

flask for your own server hosting, it isnt required to run pkos but it is recomended.

# Description: 
so PyKernelOS is a (fake???) kernel type of os in python.
thats all really need to say to get your hopes up, (or something else ðŸ¤¨)
so um, idk what to say about this os, its really just a fun project 

# nice nice, what is the frickin bios.py and other shit like PyKernelOS.boot
so ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm i forgor jk so theres uh some stuff like
1. bios.py (basically an app that allows to boot the bootloader)
2. bootloader does funkey stuff like Settings :O
3. in bootloader you get to logon.py (if u have anonymous mode on then it goes straight to main.py)
4. logon.py goes to main.py
6. fuck you i cant explain shit

# Apps
woah woah apps?!!!! you can make your own apps!!!????
yeah you can, just get ready to code in python

how tf do i make apps you dumb fuck:
1. create a file called (whateveruwant).ap3
IT HAS TO END WITH AP3!!! pkOS wont detect it that way.

2. write funny python code!!! (withering hates python)
so originally there was supposed to be go and lua support for apps
but that dose not worke :c 

3. save the app and check out the app!!!!

# built in apps?!!!
awah wah there are cool apps like calculator lmao
jk a really cool app is called ap3store.ap3
IT WAS SUPEER HARD TO DO.
really hard btw

# ap3store.ap3
so this is an app, i spent most of my time there
you download ap3 apps from a server, if you want a custom server then do:
1. download the ap3store.serverhostfiles
2. in that hot package you have flask_app.py and ap3 folder!!!
3. very hot but you need flask in order the server to run okay you got that? nice
4. after that u need to write, in your terminal or cmd type "python flask_app.py"
5. this will make a server in: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
6. now you enter the folder ap3 in that website (hosted by you)
7. and the result url would be either http://127.0.0.1:5000/ap3 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/
8. you can use "http://127.0.0.1:5000/ap3" or "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" BOTH will be fine, but you use the /ap3 one if you have errors with just the /
9. anyways now time to load it os enter your pkOS then u enter app ap3store.ap3 if you dont have that, get it simple.
10. now u hae an option with servers. choose the third option "custom url"
11. copy paste the url whne it asks you to and BAM!! you hosted your own crappy patty thingy server
12. while the server we are hosted is hosted in python anywhere, you can use that too lmao!!!

# SETTINGS??!!!!!!!
yeah settings you can set them in the files/settings/settings.json folder, 
or you can go to bootloader and u have there settings :3
